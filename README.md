What is Arceus X?
Arceus X is a script executor for Roblox, a massively popular online gaming platform that allows users to create and share their own games with the community. A script executor is a tool that allows users to run scripts, or sets of commands, within a game. This can greatly enhance the gaming experience, by adding new features and functionality to the game.

How does it work?
Arceus X works by allowing users to input scripts, or sets of commands, into the game. These scripts can then be executed by the tool, which will cause the commands to be carried out within the game. This can include things like spawning items, teleporting, or even altering the game’s physics.
